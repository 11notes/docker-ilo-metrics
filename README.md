Run ilo-metrics rootless and distroless.

# INTRODUCTION 📢

[ilo_exporter](https://github.com/MauveSoftware/ilo_exporter) (created by [MauveSoftware](https://github.com/MauveSoftware)). Metrics exporter for HP iLO to prometheus

![GRAPH](https://github.com/11notes/docker-ilo-metrics/blob/master/img/Graph.png?raw=true)

# SYNOPSIS 📖
**What can I do with this?** This image will run ilo_exporter [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md), for maximum security and performance.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION 💶
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image has no shell since it is [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md)
>* ... this image is auto updated to the latest version via CI/CD
>* ... this image has a health check
>* ... this image runs read-only
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image is very small

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.

| `gid` | 1000 | [group identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier) |
| `home` | / | home directory of user docker |

# ENVIRONMENT 📝

| `TZ` | [Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) | |
| `DEBUG` | Will activate debug option for container image and app (if available) | |
| `ILO_METRICS_USER`  | user for API request to iLO | |
| `ILO_METRICS_PASSWORD`  | password for API request to iLO | |

# MAIN TAGS 🏷️
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [1.0.3](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/ilo-metrics/tags?name=1.0.3)
* [1.0.3-unraid](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/ilo-metrics/tags?name=1.0.3-unraid)
* [1.0.3-nobody](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/ilo-metrics/tags?name=1.0.3-nobody)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is a bad habbit and should not be used at all. Many developers introduce **breaking changes** in new releases. This would messed up everything for people who use ```:latest```. If you don’t want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:1.0.3``` you can use ```:1``` or ```:1.0```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version. Which in theory should not introduce breaking changes.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# REGISTRIES ☁️
```
docker pull 11notes/ilo-metrics:1.0.3
docker pull ghcr.io/11notes/ilo-metrics:1.0.3
docker pull quay.io/11notes/ilo-metrics:1.0.3
```

# UNRAID VERSION 🟠
This image supports unraid by default. Simply add **-unraid** to any tag and the image will run as 99:100 instead of 1000:1000.

# NOBODY VERSION 👻
This image supports nobody by default. Simply add **-nobody** to any tag and the image will run as 65534:65534 instead of 1000:1000.

# PARENT IMAGE 🏛️
> [!IMPORTANT]
>This image is not based on another image but uses [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) as the starting layer.
>The image consists of the following distroless layers that were added:
>* [11notes/distroless](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/arch.dockerfile) - contains users, timezones and Root CA certificates, nothing else
>* [11notes/distroless:curl](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/curl.dockerfile) - app to execute HTTP requests

# BUILT WITH 🧰
* [ilo_exporter](https://github.com/MauveSoftware/ilo_exporter)

# GENERAL TIPS 📌
> [!TIP]
>* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx, HAproxy to terminate TLS and to protect your endpoints
>* Use Let’s Encrypt DNS-01 challenge to obtain valid SSL certificates for your services
